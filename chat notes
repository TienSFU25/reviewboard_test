ah ok.

Barret Rennie [1:40 PM]
So the iter_entry_points is called on 'reviewboard.hosting_services'

Barret Rennie [1:40 PM]
so in a python package you are allowed to define entrypoints, which have some naming convention and point to a class/method

Barret Rennie [1:41 PM]
the `entry.name` and `entry.load` come from `iter_entry_points`, which yields the name and entry point registered in packages

Barret Rennie [1:43 PM]
the entry points stuff is all defined in `pkg_resources` and im not quite sure where the entry points are defined

Barret Rennie [1:43 PM]
these may just be for third party entry points defined in extensions

Barret Rennie [1:44 PM]
I lied there is an `entry_points.txt`

Barret Rennie [1:44 PM]
its in the ReviewBoard.egg-info dir, and I dont know a lot about python packaging

Barret Rennie [1:45 PM]
@vtl-developer: if you look at the file it shows "name = entrypoint" I believe

Barret Rennie [1:46 PM]
bbiab

Vincent Le [1:48 PM] 
ohhh I see! Thanks!

David Trowbridge [1:50 PM] 
individual packages all define them in their setup.py files

David Trowbridge [1:50 PM]
so if you look at reviewboard's setup.py, you'll see a big list of all the entry points it provides

Vincent Le [1:51 PM] 
so in the setup.py, it makes a file of the entry points, and `iter_entry_points` goes through the file?

David Trowbridge [1:52 PM] 
yeah, kind of. `iter_entry_points` will look at *all* installed python packages

David Trowbridge [1:52 PM]
So other third parties can define entry points for `reviewboard.hosting_services` and reviewboard will automatically find them

Vincent Le [1:54 PM] 
so if i make packages and want them to be part of the default reviewboard setup, i should also add them to the setup.py?

David Trowbridge [1:56 PM] 
yeah, so if you had a dropbox implementation, you'd have something like `'reviewboard.file_providers': ['dropbox = ...']`
